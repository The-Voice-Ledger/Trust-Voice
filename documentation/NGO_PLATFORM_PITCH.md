# TrustVoice: Voice-First Fundraising with Transparent Impact Tracking

**Connecting European/US Donors to African Projects Through Conversational AI**

---

## The Problem

**Donor Trust Crisis:**
- 67% of donors worry their money doesn't reach intended beneficiaries
- Traditional fundraising lacks real-time impact visibility
- Complex donation processes deter small donors
- No way to verify project completion

**Current Solutions Fall Short:**
- Websites require app downloads and accounts
- Email updates are generic and infrequent
- Photos/reports can be outdated or fabricated
- No direct connection between donor and beneficiary

---

## Our Solution: TrustVoice

**Talk to donate. See where every dollar goes. Get voice updates from the field.**

### How It Works (3 Simple Steps)

**1. Donor Asks Questions**
```
Donor (via WhatsApp/Phone): "Tell me about water projects in Tanzania"
AI: "The Mwanza Water Project needs $50K to build 10 wells 
     serving 3,000 families. $28K raised so far..."
```

**2. Donate in Seconds**
```
Donor: "I want to donate $100"
AI: "Great! Pay via:
     • Credit card (secure link)
     • Bank transfer
     • Crypto (optional)
     Payment confirmed. Receipt sent!"
```

**3. Track Real Impact**
```
3 months later...
AI (voice message): "Your $100 helped complete Well #3 in Mwanza.
                     123 families now have clean water.
                     View photos: [link]"
                     
Donor clicks link → sees GPS-verified photos, blockchain receipt
```
